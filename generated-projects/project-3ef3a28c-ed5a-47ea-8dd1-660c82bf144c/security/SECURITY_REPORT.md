### 1. Sensitive data exposure (MEDIUM)
**File:** Unknown
**Line:** 14
**Description:** The `cors()` middleware is configured to allow requests from all origins (`*`). While this might be acceptable for a public health check endpoint, it is generally not recommended for production applications that handle sensitive data or require specific client interactions. An unrestricted CORS policy can make it easier for malicious websites to make cross-origin requests to your application, potentially leading to data leakage or other attacks if sensitive routes are added later.
**Recommendation:** Restrict CORS to a specific list of trusted origins. For example: `app.use(cors({ origin: ['https://yourdomain.com', 'https://anotherdomain.com'] }));`. If the application is intended to be a public API, consider if specific endpoints truly need unrestricted access or if a more granular approach is possible (e.g., using `cors` middleware only on specific routes).
